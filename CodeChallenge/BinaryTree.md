<h1>Binary Search </h1>
The provided code efficiently determines whether a sorted array contains a specific key. It achieves a time complexity of O(n), 
where n represents the length of the array. The space complexity is also O(n), as it only requires the storage of the array itself.
The code follows a simple approach of performing a linear search through the array elements until the key is found or until the end of the array is reached. 
If the key is found, the corresponding element is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned to indicate that the key is not present in the array.
